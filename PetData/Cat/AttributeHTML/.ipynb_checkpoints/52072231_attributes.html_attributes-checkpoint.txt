Description: 
Like peanut butter and jelly, cups and saucers, Kermit and Miss Piggy, some things are meant to be together. And that's especially true for Peppi and Stanley. This adorable mom and son pair were brought to SAS together, and were briefly separated, but when staff saw how much they missed each other, they were reunited at their foster parent's home. Peppi didn't eat while they were apart. When Stanley saw Peppi again, he mewed happily for the first time! They were so happy to be back together. Now they sleep together like magnets and Stanley follows his mom devotedly wherever she goes.
