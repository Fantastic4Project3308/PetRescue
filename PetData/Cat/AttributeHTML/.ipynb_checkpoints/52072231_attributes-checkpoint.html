YOUR APPLICATION WILL BE DELAYED IF YOU USE THE WRONG EMAIL ADDRESS.

Like peanut butter and jelly, cups and saucers, Kermit and Miss Piggy, some things are meant to be together. And that's especially true for Peppi and Stanley. This adorable mom and son pair were brought to SAS together, and were briefly separated, but when staff saw how much they missed each other, they were reunited at their foster parent's home. Peppi didn't eat while they were apart. When Stanley saw Peppi again, he mewed happily for the first time! They were so happy to be back together. Now they sleep together like magnets and Stanley follows his mom devotedly wherever she goes.   

This affectionate pair are beautiful inside and out. Both cats have beautiful silky fur and Peppi especially enjoys being brushed.  Her ideal home will help keep her lovely fur free from mats and looking its best. Peppi will purr whenever she is close to you and has a soft, tiny meow. Stanley has a deeper, rumbly voice and often sounds like he is narrating their exploratory trips around the house.  Their foster mom says she has never heard a hiss or growl from these two.   

Both Peppi and Stanley love to lounge on their cat tree. Peppi loves to cuddle with her foster mom. Stanley is a little more shy and sometimes hides until he is looking for affection. Then he likes to get his cheeks scratched! Both of them will let you know with a gentle head butt when they'd like some snuggles. And when they're extra happy, their tails will quiver with joy.  Peppi loves her meals and shoots to the food bowl like a rocket when she hears that it's meal time, and Stanley is never far behind.
