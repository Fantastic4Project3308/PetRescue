Description: 
Hi! I'm a sweet, timid kitty who loves head scratches and Churu treats! Once I feel comfortable with you, I'm inquisitive and playful. Toys with strings and feathers are my favorite. I also enjoy snuggling in blankets, giving head bumps and bird watching. I have very polite litter box manners. When I'm not curled up next to you, I'll be napping nearby because I like the company.
