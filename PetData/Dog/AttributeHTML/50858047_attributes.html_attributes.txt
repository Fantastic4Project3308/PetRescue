Description: 
Chewy is an active guy who loves to be outside regardless of the weather. He is a true PNW pup, he would spend all day playing in the rain if we let him! He is a busy guy looking for an equally busy home, with a routine he can learn, and plenty of outdoor adventuring. Chewy would do best in a home without younger children. His greatest wish is to go home with another dog who will run, chase, wrestle and tug with him all day. Chewy loves other dogs so much he doesn't mind sharing all of his toys, bowls, and people with them. He LOVES going for walks, and is making progress working on his leash behavior but will need a patient and persistent parent to continue his training so that everyone can love the walk as much as him!
