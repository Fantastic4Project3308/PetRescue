Are you looking for a super-smart, super-fun and super-adorable companion? Meet Meri.
 
Meri had a difficult early start in life-she was taken from her litter at just two weeks of age, so she never got the chance to be weaned by her mother or to bond and learn to socialize with her litter mates. Because of this, she has some anxiety and is nervous about other dogs. However, Meri loves her people and is very attuned to them. Watch her tilt her head as you speak to make sure she hears your every word! While Meri won't be the best walking buddy since she is anxious about things she sees in the outside world, she will keep you entertained playing in the house and the yard. 

Meri is house-trained and well behaved in the home and has no problem being left alone when you go out. In the yard, she is happy to run around, play catch with her toys, and will \“go potty\“ on command! She is very playful and loves her toys and food puzzles and any activity that keeps her mind engaged. If you are looking to hone your training skills, Meri is the perfect student! She is highly food motivated, so this makes training easy and fun. She already knows basic commands like sit, lie down, wait, off and touch, and she's learned polite behaviors such as lying down calmly while people eat and waiting at the door to exit. Meri also knows \“where's your toy?\“ and would happily play fetch all day.
 
Meri is making great progress checking in and taking a treat when she sees dogs or other things that are exciting or scary, and she is working on calmly greeting new people. Meri will do best as the only pet in a calm environment with adults and maybe dog-savvy  older kids. A fenced yard where you can play together would be ideal. Meri will blossom with a loving, patient guardian who will continue to help her feel safe in the world. Come meet this special girl and make your new year Meri and bright!
