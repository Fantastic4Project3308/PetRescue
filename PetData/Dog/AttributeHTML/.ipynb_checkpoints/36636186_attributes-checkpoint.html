	<meta property="og:description" content="Let's get Mojo adopted! His adoption fee will be waived and his adopter will only pay applicable licensing fees.

Mojo is in a foster home and is currently not at the shelter. Please find info below on how to adopt him, thanks. 

Get your Mojo on--check out his video here: https://vimeo.com

I'm on social media also! Follow me and my friends on Facebook and Instagram to see our fun adventures and learn more about us: Facebook https://www.facebook.com/SeattleAnimalShelter?mibextid=LQQJ4d

Mojo is a handsome and solid boy who all about loving people, playing, and snoozing.  Oh, and chewing on his toys and bones.   He has a rating scale that involves only 5 stars and zero stars, because he doesn't do anything halfway!  

5 STARS: being with his human tribe, snuggling during movies, belly rubs and back scratches, snoozing by the fire or sunlit window, sunbathing outside, maniacally tearing apart stuffies or nibbling on them depending on his mood, a few minutes of zoomies to get his exercise in, sleeping a solid 10 hours with his people in his own bed (or in the human bed - that might be 10 stars)!   

ZERO STARS: walking in the rain, walking in hot weather, walking when he feels like lounging, taking a bath.

He is a perfect dog in many ways. He can be left alone with the roam of the house and just sleeps. He only chews on his toys. He's potty trained. He's a hilarious home companion.  He has no resource guarding and is great with body handling, he just loves any attention!  He's smart and can be desensitized to triggers like vacuums and blenders with steady positive association.  He may not have had socialization as a puppy to normal household things like this. 

His growth opportunities are to continue to work on reducing fear/anxiety reactiveness when seeing other dogs on walks. This behavior has improved over his time in foster: with repeat exposure when he knows a dog is no threat he can usually pass across the street with minimal concern if distracted with treats.  Squirrels and bunnies are either his nemesis or his dream (probably to catch them!) so he definitely can't live with cats or critters.  He does well with older dog savvy kids, we just don't have info on how he does with younger children. He's a candidate for happily living in a quiet neighborhood mostly at home, not a man about town.

The only reason his foster parents aren't adopting him is that he needs to be the only dog in the home, and they wish to keep fostering.  

HOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match. If you have questions about this dog that have not been answered above, please contact us at adoptionreview@gmail.com. If you would like to arrange to meet this dog, you must submit an adoption application. Thank you!" />
