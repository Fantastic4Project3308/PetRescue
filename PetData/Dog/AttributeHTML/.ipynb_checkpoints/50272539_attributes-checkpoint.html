Name: Thomas (Chester)
Nicknames: Tommy, Tom-Tom
Theme song: \“Lean on Me\“ by Bill Withers
Breed: Anatolian Shepherd
Sex: Male/Neutered
Key descriptors: Shy, sweet, playful, food-motivated. Goofball! Gorgeous face and eyes!
Affection level: Medium to high
What we love most: Thomas may be initially shy, but once he warms up to you, he becomes a playful and affectionate companion, flopping in your lap for some love. He loves playing with balls (he may not bring it back to you though!). Thomas is also highly food-motivated, which makes him easy to train and teach new tricks.
What he loves most: Thomas loves playing with balls and spending quality time with his people. He also enjoys sniffing and exploring new places.
Dogs: Thomas is subject to a meet and greet but might along with other dogs his own size, as long as they are calm and self-assured.
Cats/critters: Thomas prefers a home with no cats or small animals.
Kids: While we cannot guarantee Thomas' behavior around kids, we believe he may do well with older, calm children who can respect his boundaries.

We understand that Thomas may seem shy and anxious at first (especially with men), but with the right training and patience, he has the potential to become a loyal and loving companion. He know lots of cues: sit, stay, come, shake, spin, and leave it! If you're willing to give him a chance, Thomas will reward you with his playful and affectionate personality. Come meet Thomas and see if he's the perfect match for your family.
