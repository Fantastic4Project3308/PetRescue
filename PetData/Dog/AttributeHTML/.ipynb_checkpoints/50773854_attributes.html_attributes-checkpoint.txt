Description: 
Key descriptors: Spunky. Sassy. Smart but also just the right amount of dumb.
If she had a quote in her Instagram bio: Live. Laugh. Toys.
-Energy level: Medium. If you are lounging, she is lounging with you. If you are active, she's down for some fun too.
-Affection level: Medium. Will snuggle right up to you and ask kindly for (read: demand) pets.
-What we love most: Her love for playing tug, followed by her froggy-legging out of pure exhaustion. Her greetings anytime you come to her kennel door: she makes you feel like you are the most important person on earth, and she is your biggest cheerleader. Her mismatched ears. Her enthusiasm for all things toys.
-What she loves most: As mentioned above, tug. Giving her toys jazzy haircuts. Car rides. Snoozing. Frozen kongs.
-Kids: Teen+, as she can be exuberant
-Dogs: No thank you.
-Cats: Nope. Thinks they are toys and wants to chase just a bit too much.
