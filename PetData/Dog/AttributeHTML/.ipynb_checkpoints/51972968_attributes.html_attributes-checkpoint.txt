Description: 
Come adopt River Otter and enjoy his affectionate and playful nature. He loves treats and will tug on the leash in excitement. Be prepared to deliver treats before he turns to grab the leash! He's a curious dog who loves to watch his surroundings and is not shy about expressing his excitement. His medium to high affection level will melt your heart, and you'll be sure to have a great time with this guy. River Otter may not be a great fit for households with kids, and is subject to meet and greet with other dogs. You can give River Otter the forever home he deserves!
