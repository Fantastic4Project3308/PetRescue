Description: 
Angel may be shy, but she has so much love to give to the right family. She's looking for patient and understanding adopters who will give her the time and space she needs to feel comfortable in her new home. Angel would thrive in a calm and quiet household with no kids or other pets. If you're looking for a loyal and affectionate companion, come meet our Angel at the Seattle Animal Shelter!
