-Name: Peter
-Nicknames: Petey
-Theme song: \“I Wanna Be Your Dog\“ by The Stooges
-Breed: American Pit Bull Terrier
-Sex: Male/neutered
-Key descriptors: Shy at first, loves cuddles and belly rubs, enjoys car rides and baths, house-trained, very treat-motivated, knows basic commands.
-Affection level: High
-What we love most: We adore how affectionate Peter is once he gets to know you. Being incredibly treat-motivated, he's a joy to train.
-What he loves most: Peter loves attention and treats. He also enjoys car rides and baths (how great is that!), and will happily play fetch with you for hours on end.
-Dogs: Peter wants to be your only pet please
-Kids: This guy is best suited to an adult-only home

Peter is a sweet boy who just needs the right home to thrive. He can be shy at first, but once he warms up to you, he's an absolute love bug. He's house-trained and knows basic commands, making him a joy to have around the house. He hasn't yet been crate trained.

Peter can be a bit of a picky eater, but bone broth is a great way to entice him to eat his meals. He also prefers wet food and needs it mixed in with his kibble to make it more appetizing. He's also very treat motivated, so training him is a breeze.

It's important to note that he doesn't like to be woken up suddenly (who does?). With his prey drive toward birds, a home without any feathered friends (or any small animal) is a must. Peter doesn't enjoy other dogs, and will thrive as your one and only!

Overall, we think Peter would do best in a one-dog household with an experienced adopter who understands his needs. He's a loving and loyal companion who just needs someone to give him the chance he so deserves.

To meet Peter, please download and fill out an adoption survey (found here) - http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/AnimalShelter/Dog%20Adoption%20Questionnaire_Fillable.pdf and email it to animalcare@seattle.gov -
- and/or visit the shelter during our open hours: Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday 1pm to 5pm, no appointment needed." />
