Description: 
Scout is handsome and sweet and exuberant. This athletic boy loves to go on long walks and is generally well behaved on his leash and easily redirected if he gets excited seeing other dogs or critters. He would love to be part of an active household where he can go jogging with you or join you on long walks, hikes or other adventures. Scout is a very smart boy, too-check out all the commands he knows: sit, down, wait, shake, go get a toy, play, let's go and all done! He has had some private training sessions and did very well, so he is ready to learn even more.
