Description: 
Pickles didn't have the best start to his life...he came to us from a situation where he was not consistently treated with love and kindness. It takes a little bit of time for him to warm up and trust, but once you're in he is totally in love with you! He spent some time in a foster home, and his foster parent told us Pickles was so sweet and loving. He was an incredibly polite houseguest! His favorite nap spots were on the couch or on the floor next to it with his people nearby for some petting and affection. In the morning he likes to run his zoomies out and is always up for a game of ball in the yard. He's super athletic and very fast! He walks fairly well on leash, but will pull sometimes. The good news is that he's treat motivated and is a quick study, so he's ready to learn to have better leash manners.
