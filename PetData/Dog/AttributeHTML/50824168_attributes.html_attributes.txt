Description: 
Luna loves her people, and once she bonds with you, she will be your Cuddle Queen. Luna has a playful side, but most often her favorite activity is curling up on the couch with her person-and maybe getting some belly rubs, too. Luna is sweet and gentle, and will thrive in a calm home, ideally with a gentle, consistent person who is retired or who works from home (she loves to be in your company). Luna enjoys going on walks and exploring the outdoors. She can be fearful at times, so she will benefit from help building her confidence. In addition to being sweet, Luna is smart girl (she can figure out a food puzzle in a snap), and she is polite, too-she will wait for permission before going through doorways! Luna is looking for her forever home with someone who can give her the patience, love and attention she deserves (and she will return it tenfold). Come meet Luna--she'll light up your life!
