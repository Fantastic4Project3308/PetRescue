Description: 
I'm a Golden Girl in dog form: sassy, sprightly, and a card-carrying member of the AARP. An athletic and active gal, my hobbies include food puzzles, enjoying belly rubs, and tap dancing! I need a kind adopter to make me feel safe and loved for the rest of my years: someone to appreciate my marvelous, unique qualities. I'm a resilient, physically strong, sweetie-pie: well-mannered indoors, and don't require long walks, but would be happiest with a quiet yard of my own. No humans under 12 years, or kitties or doggos please.
