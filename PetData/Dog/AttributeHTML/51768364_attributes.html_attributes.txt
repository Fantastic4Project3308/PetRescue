Dogs: Wrexham wants to be your one and only, but he's social and likes to play with other dogs under the right circumstances. He needs an experienced owner who can provide him with proper training and socialization.
Kids: His last owners report that he is gentle with children, but he's a big boy, so supervision is a must.
