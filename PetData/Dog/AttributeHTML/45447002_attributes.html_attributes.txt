Description: 
Hi, I'm Puck, and like most everyone, I have some quirks but that just makes me more interesting. My foster mom says I have lots of "nuance"... If you don't know what a Belgian Malinois is, you should read up about us - we are known for loyalty, herding and protection. Me personally, well I'm almost five years old, and have often been told that I'm a handsome boy with my shiny brindle coat and expressive ears. I'm also a fast sprinter with quick reflexes and I love to hunt for small critters outside and chase soccer balls!
