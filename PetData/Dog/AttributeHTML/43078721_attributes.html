Ra is in a foster home and is currently not at the shelter. Please find info below on how to adopt him or foster-to-adopt (which gives you a chance to spend a week or two with him in your home and decide if he's a good match)

I'm on social media also! Follow me and my friends on Facebook and Instagram to see our fun adventures and learn more about us:

Ra is a spirited and smart boy with loads of personality. He's looking for the perfect forever home with the right balance of love, training and structure to help him continue to blossom. 

--Ra was born in 2018, he weighs just about 60 pounds, and we think he's a pittie mix. His defining features are his big noggin, always-at-attention ears and the curvy line fur down the right side of his face.

**Ra's foster family calls him a sweet and energetic little goofball. They say he loves walks, quality time with his people, evening couch cuddles, and daily training games that engage his mind and body. 

**His current nicknames include Roger, Roster, and Squeakquel. 

**Did someone say treats?! Ra is food-motivated, which makes him eager to learn and very teachable.

**Ra loves car rides! He's so quiet and relaxed in the back seat, you may forget he's there.

**This guy craves stability and a routine. There are so many exciting things going on in the outside world, and Ra is most at ease when he's in a comfortable, calm environment he knows with a person or people he loves. 

**Ra has shown some resource-guarding behavior toward toys and his dog bed. We have seen tremendous improvement over time with daily training games and as his foster parents have gained his trust. Still, we think a household with no kids would be best.

**On walks, Ra can be too interested in other dogs-especially those who seek to engage him. Treat-training on walks works particularly well, and it's something Ra's current fosters and trainers can easily teach his future person(s) to continue with. Ra wants to be the apple of your eye, so he needs to be an only pet.

**Ra is crate-trained, potty-trained, and has all of his basic training cues down. What a fabulous boy!
