Description: 
Meet Huck! This handsome, sweet boy will be a wonderful addition to an active home where he can take part in the action. He may even be a great agility candidate, dock diver, or other dog sports. Huck loves to go for walks and is calm and well behaved on his leash. He loves playing with other dogs his size. He is even learning to sit before crossing city streets. Huck is a smart boy, too-he just learned "lay down" and makes a big show of doing that with a big belly flop. He listens well and is ready to learn lots more. Huck has bursts of energy at home (though his foster family has never heard him bark!), but he settles down well and that's when the cuddling begins! If you are looking for an energetic, sweet and affectionate companion, come meet Huck!
