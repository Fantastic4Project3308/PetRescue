Description: 
Rocco is a handsome guy who's looking for his forever home. He's sweet, gentle, and playful, and appears to be house-trained. He may bark at new people but does well when allowed to approach them on his own terms and receive treats. He's also quiet and calm inside the home, where he likes to lie on the couch and follow his person around. Rocco is a big chewer of hard rubber toys and is food-motivated. He knows basic commands such as "sit," "down," "wait/stay," "up," and "shake." Rocco has not had experience with children. He does want to chase squirrels with his prey drive, but he's redirectable. His perfect family is out there - could it be you? Why not come meet him and find out!
