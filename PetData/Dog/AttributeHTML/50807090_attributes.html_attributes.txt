Description: 
Meri had a difficult early start in life-she was taken from her litter at just two weeks of age, so she never got the chance to be weaned by her mother or to bond and learn to socialize with her litter mates. Because of this, she has some anxiety and is nervous about other dogs. However, Meri loves her people and is very attuned to them. Watch her tilt her head as you speak to make sure she hears your every word! While Meri won't be the best walking buddy since she is anxious about things she sees in the outside world, she will keep you entertained playing in the house and the yard.
