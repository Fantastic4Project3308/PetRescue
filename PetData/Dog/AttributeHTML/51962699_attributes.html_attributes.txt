Affection level: Very affectionate and loves attention. (He looks so serious in his photos - but he's not!)
What we love most: Debo is a young pup with a lot of energy and a lot of love to give. He's already learned Sit, Down and Touch.
What he loves most: Debo loves to explore and sniff everything in sight. He hasn't really figured out fetch yet, but he's eager to learn new things and loves to please his humans. He also loves attention and cuddles, and he's always up for a good belly rub.
