Pickles didn't have the best start to his life...he came to us from a situation where he was not consistently treated with love and kindness. It takes a little bit of time for him to warm up and trust, but once you're in he is totally in love with you! He spent some time in a foster home, and his foster parent told us Pickles was so sweet and loving. He was an incredibly polite houseguest! His favorite nap spots were on the couch or on the floor next to it with his people nearby for some petting and affection. In the morning he likes to run his zoomies out and is always up for a game of ball in the yard. He's super athletic and very fast! He walks fairly well on leash, but will pull sometimes. The good news is that he's treat motivated and is a quick study, so he's ready to learn to have better leash manners.

Because of Pickles' hard start to life he is looking for a family to provide him with a stable, calm and consistent home. He would do best in a home without children, but might do okay with older teens who can respect his needs. He will need his family to allow him to become comfortable in his own time, and to understand that he would not be comfortable in a bustling home with lots of activity and visitors.

Pickles is learning that people can be kind and loving and we're really seeing this sweet boy blossom into a more confident, affectionate, playful dog. We can't wait to see him connect and grow with a family who will continue to help him understand what it is to be a beloved and treasured family member.

To meet this dog, please download and fill out an adoption survey (found here) - http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/AnimalShelter/Dog%20Adoption%20Questionnaire_Fillable.pdf and email it to animalcare@seattle.gov -
