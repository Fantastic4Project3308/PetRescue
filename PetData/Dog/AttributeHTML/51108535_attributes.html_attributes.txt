Description: 
Look at this handsome boy! Thor loves belly rubs and is a total cuddler. He's very smart - he listens to commands, and already knows how to sit, stay, lie down, and touch! He's potty trained, too. Thor can be wary of strangers and requires slow introduction with new people. However, he is incredibly affectionate once he warms up to you (he thinks he's a lap dog!). He's the perfect balance of ‘always at your side' and ‘independent enough to chill on his own during the workday.' He has good manners in the house-he rarely barks and is respectful of the furniture!
