Description: 
Hoss is a sweet-natured, easy-going lovebug. His favorite thing in the world is snuggling up with a human, and his second favorite is burrowing under a blanket. In his foster home, he has shown that he gets along well with cats and other small dogs. He'll snuggle with any critter that will let him! When he's not busy snuggling or burrowing, Hoss enjoys playing with squeaky toys and going for short walks. He loves car rides, but he's also happy to stay home while you're out stocking up on kibble.
This affectionate little guy would love to meet you!
