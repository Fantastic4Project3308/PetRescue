                    <b>About Us: </b>
                    <br><br>
                  FurEver Pet is a pet rescue and adoption website that was founded in February 2023 by a group of computer science students at the University of Colorado Boulder. The team, consisting of Mayra, Brittany, Zack, and Mayumi, came together with a shared passion for technology and a desire to make a positive impact in the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  As the team developed their software development skills in their core class, CSPB3308, they began to work on the website early on their project. They spent countless hours designing and coding, testing and refining, until they finally had a working prototype that they were proud to share with the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  Since then, FurEver Pet has grown into a thriving community of pet lovers who are passionate about helping animals find their forever homes. The website has helped hundreds of pets find loving families, and the team continues to work tirelessly to improve the user experience and promote animal welfare.<br>
                    <br>
At FurEver Pet, we are committed to making a difference in the lives of animals and their human companions. Thank you for joining us on this journey!
